Learning javascript from scratch using a technique called thuggishCoding. What we do to learn a new language is we break down small concepts and put each one into their own file. We want to start with one example first, 1st step is to think about the code abstracilly, what that means is how will the piece of code look like in physical life. Here in this step we do drawing that will help us understand the code better. 2nd step is start coding, go slow. thugs in 90s got through went they went slow, but when they were riding fast they got killed(BIGGIE, TUPAC). Don't kill your coding skills. Once your're good with the concept this means after messing with your code(testing) to see how it works, then you're ready to move on to the final step. Final step is read the code and draw it a piece of paper. You are now ready to be a thugg(thugs make money)
